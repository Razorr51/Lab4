    "\n",
    "### The Department of Outdated Government Encyclopedias (DOGE) Launches Revolutionary NLP Project to Rescue Public Knowledge  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Washington, D.C.** — In a bold step toward modernizing the nation’s most chaotic digital archives, the   **Department of Outdated Government Encyclopedias (DOGE)** today announced the launch of its new initiative:  🚀 **Project CleanSearch AI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, citizens have struggled to find simple answers hidden inside massive, noisy, and poorly structured government knowledge repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Who won the Nobel Prize in 1930?”  \n",
    "- “When did Angola become independent?”  \n",
    "\n",
    "have resulted in thousands of irrelevant web pages, confusing biographies and excessive scrolling 📉\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“Frankly, our archives are a mess,”* said a DOGE spokesperson.  \n",
    "> *“They’re long, noisy and about as searchable as a pile of printed Wikipedia pages thrown into a hurricane.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 The Solution  \n",
    "\n",
    "DOGE has assembled an elite team of AI specialists, hired from UM DACS 2nd year bachelor program with the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Clean decades of messy digital text  \n",
    "✅ Extract meaningful knowledge  \n",
    "✅ Replace outdated keyword search with modern **retrieval systems**  \n",
    "✅ Deliver instant, accurate answers to citizens  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using real-world noisy data similar to the government’s archives, the team will experiment with multiple retrieval models to determine the most efficient approach, methods which have been taught in the fabulous classes of some person quoted as J.S. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whispers across the digital corridors suggest that DOGE may soon supercede the legendary Project 2-2, though DACS management insist these rumours are “under control.”\n"

    "\n",
    "The final deliverable for this lab is a **scientific poster** presenting your work on building and evaluating a sentence retrieval system using the TriviaQA dataset.\n",
    "- 📏 **Size:** A0 or A1  \n",
    "- 🧭 **Orientation:** Portrait or landscape (your choice)  \n",
    "- 📑 **Layout:** Clear section structure (e.g., columns or blocks)  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your poster should include the following sections:\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ Problem & Motivation 🎯\n",
    "- Describe the retrieval task (query → correct answer document) and the challenges\n",
    "- Briefly introduce the dataset and its challenges  \n",
    "#### 2️⃣ Data Preparation 🧹\n",
    "Explain:\n",
    "- Train / validation / test splitting  \n",
    "- Your cleaning pipeline (at least 6 preprocessing steps)  \n",
    "Include at least one **before vs after cleaning** example.\n",
    "#### 3️⃣ Retrieval Models 🤖\n",
    "Present and explain the modes you used:\n",
    "- Bag-of-Words + cosine similarity  \n",
    "- TF-IDF + cosine similarity  \n",
    "- Sentence embeddings (averaged word embeddings)  \n",
    "- [any other model?] \n",
    "Discuss strengths and limitations of each.\n",
    "#### 4️⃣ Qualitative Analysis 🔍\n",
    "Provide:\n",
    "- At least **3 successful retrieval examples**  \n",
    "- At least **3 failure cases**  \n",
    "Explain why each worked or failed.\n",
    "#### 5️⃣ Quantitative Evaluation 📊 (Main focus)\n",

    "- Which method you would recommend and why  \n",
    "- Key tradeoffs  \n",
    "- Possible improvements  \n",
    "### 🎨 Optional Creative Element (Bonus)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may (optionally) present your poster within the fictional storyline of 🏛️ **DOGE — Department of Outdated Government Encyclopedias**, where your retrieval system modernizes chaotic national archives and replaces legacy keyword search. Creativity is welcome, but scientific clarity is the priority. We will vote for the \"most creative poster\".\n",
